The folder Signed_ADJ contains all the code needed for evaluation of the proposed methods GADJ* and all the synthetic graphs with thier generator. Other folders contain the corresponding real data. The data can be manually loaded into the workspace of Matlab interface. The code was inplemented in Matlab.

Generalized_ADJCluster() is the main function including a detailed description in the header and Run2.m provides all kinds of examples of how to use it.

real_graph_examples.mat and syn_graph_examples.mat contains some real datasets and all the synthetic datasets used in the paper.
